# Facial-Recognition
A machine learning project that trains on an individual face and identifies them based on their name class. This model only uses binary classification but if we edit some code, we can do multiple facial recognitions. The model is trained on personal photos which are not included in the git. To box the face from webcam we have used cv2,haar_cascade.
The testing data are photos downloaded from google.
